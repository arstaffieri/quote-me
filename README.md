Project Overview
The Quote Me application was created for those who like to see random quotes, search for quotes by particular people, and read a breif bio of those people. 

Context
I developed this project as my final showcase project at the end of Module 3 at the Turing School for Software Development and Design after 34 weeks as a front-end developer. The project took at approximately six days to completely from planning to documentation while balancing a full courseload.

Learning Goals
Demonstrate proficiency of the following:

React through displaying data from my API, allowing users to filter
Router
Asynchronous JavaScript
End-to-end testing with Cypress
I accomplished these learning goals by creating my own backend API with Node.js and Express, using React to display data from my API, creating functionality that allows the user to filter recipes by ingredients, select a burger recipe, and navigate to a page that shows a description, serving size, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions to make the recipe. Using Router ensured that the user can move back and forth between the home view and recipe view. All user flows were tested in Cypress.

Reflections
This was my first solo project using React and using media queries to make an application reponsive across devices. While I deepened my understanding of react fundamentals, if I had to do it again, I might have challenged myself to investigate and implement hooks and Router v6. My greatest win for this project is the end to end Cypress testing. One challenge or reminder during this project was the asynchronous nature of JavaScript.
